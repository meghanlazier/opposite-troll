# Roadmap

The Opposite of a Troll project allows anyone to name the opposite of a troll and submit online content and interactions that exemplify the ideas of an anti-troll. We’re on a mission to do two things:
Crowdsource names for the opposite of a troll. What is one word that we can use to identify the opposite of a troll?
Curate and share online content and interactions that exemplifies the type of behavior, interactions and spirit of we want to see online.

# Get Involved
This issue is our roadmap. It's a place to start to investigate the myriad of issues that you can contribute to. Check out the different milestones listed below, but feel free to explore the issues by label too.

Please check out our README for an overview if you haven't read it yet!

Milestone: Content Creation
When people arrive at our project site, we need to be able to explain what we’re doing. This milestone will be complete when all the content is written and posted online.
Writing the FAQs
Writing the Contribute page
Writing the submission form

Milestone: Website Launch
While content is being written, we’ll also be hard at work launching our website. Our site will need a bit more than basic functionality.

Form submissions: How do we receive forms? How do submitters receive confirmation?
Displaying content: How does content from submissions display on our site? Is it possible to sort or refresh content in different ways?
Name submissions: How do we display name suggestions for the opposite of a troll? Is it integrated into the content, gifs and screenshots we receive? Is it separate? Is there a space for discussion? 
Milestone: Social Media Integration 
In order for our project to grow, we’d like to add in social media integration.

Submitters can share their submission to social media with one click 
Anyone browsing the site can share content they’ve seen on social media 

Milestone: Ongoing issues
Although we've given this a milestone label, these are really just issues that will just always be ongoing so you can contribute at any time.
