Welcome
Thank you for your interest in learning more about the Opposite of a Troll Project. 

# Our Project

We’re on a mission to attempt to name, recognize and celebrate the behavior online that’s at the opposite end of the spectrum of how a troll behaves. 

Why should you care? Because Internet users cannot currently name the opposite of a troll in one word. It’s much easier to identify and name the behavior we don’t want to see online, versus the behavior we do. This is a problem because it’s difficult to talk about what we can’t name. Help us make altruism online a part of our vocabulary.

We’re on a mission to do two things:
Crowdsource names for the anti-troll. What is one word that we can use to identify the opposite of a troll?
Curate and share online content and interactions that exemplifies the type of behavior, interactions and spirit of we want to see online.

# Origins

This project started as an idea for a submission for an interactive gallery at MozFest, in London in October 2017. The project will debut at MozFest where we’ll get submissions for ideas on naming opposite of a troll. The submissions from the space will be be the first content on the website.
