What’s the Opposite of a Troll? is a collaborative project to attempt to name, recognize and celebrate the behavior online that’s at the opposite end of the spectrum of how a troll behaves.
Welcome
Thank you for your interest in learning more about the Opposite of a Troll Project. 

# Our Project
We’re on a mission to attempt to name, recognize and celebrate the behavior online that’s at the opposite end of the spectrum of how a troll behaves. 

Why should you care? Because Internet users cannot currently name the opposite of a troll in one word. It’s much easier to identify and name the behavior we don’t want to see online, versus the behavior we do. This is a problem because it’s difficult to talk about what we can’t name. Help us make altruism online a part of our vocabulary.

We’re on a mission to do two things:
Crowdsource names for the anti-troll. What is one word that we can use to identify the opposite of a troll?
Curate and share online content and interactions that exemplifies the type of behavior, interactions and spirit of we want to see online.

# Origins
This project started as an idea for a submission for an interactive gallery at MozFest, in London in October 2017. The project will debut at MozFest where we’ll get submissions for ideas on naming opposite of a troll. The submissions from the space will be be the first content on the website.

# Get Involved
Want to join us? Get started by subscribing to our email list for project updates. We’ll update you as soon as it’s possible to submit and curate.

We’re always looking for help with front and backend development, content creation and potential partnerships.
